    "It helps to Concatenate pandas objects along a particular axis with optional set logic along the other axes.\n",

    "Arguements:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1) objs : a sequence or mapping of Series, DataFrame, or Panel objects\n",
    "    If a dict is passed, the sorted keys will be used as the keys argument, unless it is passed, in which case the values will     be selected . Any None objects will be dropped silently unless they are all None in which case a ValueError will be raised.\n",

    "   4) join_axes : list of Index objects\n",
    "    Specific indexes to use for the other n - 1 axes instead of performing inner/outer set logic\n",
    "\n",
    "   5) ignore_index : boolean, default False\n",
    "    If True, do not use the index values along the concatenation axis. The resulting axis will be labeled 0, …, n - 1. This is     useful if you are concatenating objects where the concatenation axis does not have meaningful indexing information. Note       the index values on the other axes are still respected in the join.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   6) keys : sequence, default None\n",
    "    If multiple levels passed, should contain tuples. Construct hierarchical index using the passed keys as the outermost level\n",
    "\n",
    "   7) levels : list of sequences, default None\n",
    "    Specific levels (unique values) to use for constructing a MultiIndex. Otherwise they will be inferred from the keys\n",
    "\n",
    "   8) names : list, default None\n",
    "    Names for the levels in the resulting hierarchical index\n",
    "\n",
    "   9) verify_integrity : boolean, default False\n",
    "    Checks whether the new concatenated axis contains duplicates. This can be very expensive relative to the actual data           concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "   10) sort : boolean, default None\n",
    "     Sort non-concatenation axis if it is not already aligned when join is ‘outer’. The current default of sorting is                deprecated and will change to not-sorting in a future version of pandas.Explicitly pass sort=True to silence the warning        and sort. Explicitly pass sort=False to silence the warning and not sort.\n",
